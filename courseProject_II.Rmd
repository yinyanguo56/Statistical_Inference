##Overview
This is a report (part II) for "Statistical Inference Course Project. hypothesis tests on ToothGrowth data (len in each supp, and len in each dose).  

##Get data and summerize data  
```{r projectII-1}
library(datasets)
summary(ToothGrowth)
```

## explore  tooth growth by supp    
```{r projectII-2}
boxplot(len~supp,data=ToothGrowth, main="len supp Data",
        xlab="supp", ylab="len")
```

## Hypothesis tests and difference interval  
H0: Mu(OJ)=Mu(VC)       Ha: Mu(OJ)<>Mu(VC), alpha=0.05  

```{r }
## assume equal variance
OJ<- ToothGrowth[ToothGrowth$supp=="OJ",1]
VC<- ToothGrowth[ToothGrowth$supp=="VC",1]
t.test(OJ,VC, var.equal=TRUE, paired=FALSE)

## assume variance are not equal
t.test(ToothGrowth$len~ToothGrowth$supp)
```
## conclusion:
  Tooth len is not significant different between supp(OJ) and sup(VC) with given alpha.

## explore  tooth growth by dose    
```{r projectII-3}
boxplot(len~dose,data=ToothGrowth, main="len dose Data",
        xlab="dose", ylab="len")
tapply(ToothGrowth$len, ToothGrowth$dose, mean)
```

## ANOVA test since there are > 2 levels in dose  

```{r}
Tooth.df =ToothGrowth
Tooth.df$Dosegroup = factor(Tooth.df$dose)
Tooth.mod1 = lm(len ~ Dosegroup, data = Tooth.df)
anova(Tooth.mod1)
summary(Tooth.mod1)
```
## Conclusion1:
- ANOVA comparison results showed at least two doses their tooth len are different    
- In 3 doses comparison. Dose 0.5 is significant different with the other 2 doses (in default, lm uses level1 dose=0.5 as baseline)  
```{r}  

## compare  dose(1) vs dose (2)
mat<- cbind(rep(1/3, 3), " 1 vs 2"=c(0,1,-1)," 0.5 vs 1"=c(-1,1,0))
mymat <- solve(t(mat))
my.contrast <- mymat[,2:3]
contrasts(Tooth.df$Dosegroup) <- my.contrast
summary.lm(aov(len ~ Dosegroup, data = Tooth.df))
```
## Conclusion2:
- Comparison results showed there is significant different in tooth len in dose (1) with dose(2).   

## Final conclusion
There are significant difference among three doses on tooth len.

Notes: the significant tests above is based on the assumption that the len data are normal distribution, and variance in three doses are the same.
